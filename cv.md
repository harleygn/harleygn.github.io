## Extra-curricular

### Hackathons

Participation in hackathons has allowed me to put my skills to the test in a computer science and software context, requiring spontaneous ideas and effective collaboration, upon which my goal-driven attitude thrives. Combining this with my ability to perform under pressure has made me adaptable to any environment.

### Duke of Edinburgh

During the summer of 2015 I hiked 54 KM over three days as a member of a team in the Peak District, utilising teamwork and communication skills. This provided me with a platform from which to apply my talent for planning and problem-solving while fulfilling my love of hiking and the outdoors.

### Volunteering

At a young age, I became involved in Scouting, and it has paved the way for the volunteering that I continue today. As a Scout leader, I am always keen to organise and deliver interesting and educational sessions to the younger people in the community, sharing my experience along the way. My volunteering extends to other charities too. I spent a week last summer working with the local charity Operation Orphan, preparing clothing and donations to be delivered to those in need.
